# Modern-JavaScript-2.0
This is my repo to keep my files from Brad's course "Modern JavaScript From The Beginning 2.0".

Theses are my attempts at the projects from the [Modern JavaScript from the Beginning 2.0]([https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/](https://www.traversymedia.com/modern-javascript-2-0)) course by [Brad Traversy.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradtraversy/)

# Course Description:
This is a 37+ hour in-depth course that will take you from the absolute beginning of JavaScript, learning about data types, functions and loops to learning DOM manipulation, asynchronous JS with promises, async/await and much more. You will even learn how to write unit tests for algorithms. We go into how JavaScript works under the hood including execution context, the call stack, event loop, etc. We learn about Webpack tooling and how to create a modern development environment. At the end, we build a Node.js/Express API with a custom Webpack frontend.

The course is available on udemy and other locations, but if you get it from Brad's site like I did there is some cool extras.
